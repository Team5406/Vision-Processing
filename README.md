# Vision-Processing
Here is the code I worked on for vision processing. I think I fixed the problem I had last time. I used a grip filter incorrectly and the filter wasnt even necessary. Hopefully it works. Right now the code will only read the the largest contour it finds.
To find the IP of the Axis Camera you have to use the AxisCameraSetup. The camera is already setup so all you have to do is put the ip in the code.
AxisCameraSetup can be found at C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2016\project\Axis Camera Tool
